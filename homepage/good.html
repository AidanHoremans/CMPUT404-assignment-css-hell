            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a fourth year computer science student at the <a href = "https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html">University of Alberta</a>, I transferred to the University of Alberta after a year at <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/artsci/math-computer-science">University of Lethbridge</a>. I have a particular interest in Software Engineering and development.
                Outside of school I love playing the guitar, listening to music, and programming fun throwaway projects with friends. <br>
                When not in school or working I love spending my time on the west coast at the ocean or playing games with friends. I also have a Miniature Schnauzer named Oskar (pictured below).

            <p>
                In 2022 I completed an 8 month internship at <a href="https://symend.com/">Symend</a>, working on the messaging outreach system, interfacing with
                twilio and sendgrid to schedule and send information to customers. This messaging backend utilized C# and was part of a broad API design driven product, which gave
                invaluable experience in understanding how to build an application with independent and scalable components.

            <p>
                I have experience working in AGILE teams, and am comfortable with the microsoft suite of tools and software. I am a committed and driven developer who can quickly learn and adapt to new development situtations,
                looking to expand my knowledge with various development experiences. I am especially interested in backend system development, but am flexible and fully committed to product success in any development setting. <br>
                I also have past experience with multiple customer service and teaching jobs, which has allowed me to further develop and refine my communication skills, something I find invaluable in my success and potential in teamwork.
